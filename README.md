m12.io
======

This package is a complete [m12.io](http://m12.io) website, incl. the initial content.

## Build process

Look at [Build/README.md](Build/README.md), which describes build process to make the website up and running. At least you'll need to run `gulp` so it'll build and compile all necessary resources.
